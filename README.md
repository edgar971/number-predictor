# Image Recognition using Tensorflow.js
A simple number predictor demo built using a Tensorflow.js model trained on the MNIST dataset. 

### Pre-trained Model
 The pre-trained model used by default was trained locally on a Mac machine using Keras and then converted to a Tensorflow.js format.

### Browser Trained Model
The local model is trained locally in-browser using Tensorflow.js.

## Model
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 5 layers, 1 input 3 hidden and 1 for output. See code for more on activation function and other info on the model.
